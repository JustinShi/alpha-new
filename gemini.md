## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based application for interacting with the Alpha trading platform. Its primary functions include managing trading orders, querying and claiming airdrops, and handling multiple user accounts.

## Key Technologies

- **Language:** Python
- **Core Libraries:** `aiohttp` for asynchronous HTTP requests, `websockets` for real-time communication.
- **Dependency Management:** `pyproject.toml` is the primary source for dependencies. `requirements.txt` also exists.
- **Configuration:** YAML and JSON files located in the `config/` directory.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains all the core application source code.
    - **`main.py`**: The main entry point of the application.
    - **`api_clients/`**: Modules for interacting with external APIs (trading, user data, etc.).
    - **`models/`**: Data models representing application entities (e.g., User, Order).
    - **`services/`**: Business logic layer that orchestrates operations.
    - **`utils/`**: Shared utility functions, including logging and proxy management.
- **`config/`**: Stores all user and application configurations (`users_pc.json`, `airdrop_config.yaml`, etc.).
- **`data/`**: Holds runtime data, such as the user session database (`users_session.db`) and cached credentials. This directory is in `.gitignore`.
- **`logs/`**: Contains log files generated by the application. This directory is in `.gitignore`.
- **`scripts/`**: A collection of helper scripts for tasks like cleaning caches or generating configs.
- **`tests/`**: Contains automated tests for the application.
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Defines project metadata and dependencies for installation with `pip install .`.
